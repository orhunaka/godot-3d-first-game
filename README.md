# Squash the Creeps!
This is a game made with Godot Game Engine by following the official tutorial on [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)

## The Concept
The concept of the game is to.. well, dodge the creeps. The enemies randomly generate on a path, and when they collide with the player, the game ends.
